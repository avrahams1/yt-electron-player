1. Change title of current song - just the song name, huge text (like YT)
2. Enable folding the list?
3. Use better font, see what font is used on YT? In the original example?
4. Seperate playlist picker to its own slice, add logic that loads the playlist's name when its typed, make fancy list
5. Add "remember" to playlist picker that skips it, add option to go back from player
6. Deal with unavailable vids (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AURG1edsRPE)
